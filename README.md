The Dark Tower Adventures (C Rewrite)

Special Thanks to apam for his assitance and bugfixes.

BBS Door Game using OpenDoors

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DRPanther/TDTA-C.svg?token=KMBKVWNe7KxPHS8erLJA&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/DRPanther/TDTA-C)

TDTA is inspired by both LORD and Arrowbridge door games. It has elements
of both, while being inspired by Stephen King.

Installation:
Only tested on Linux at this point. Clone the repository, and run 'make' in the
directory. This will compile all of the files needed using gcc.

In order to compile, it needs files from the Opendoors library, which are
included in this repo. It uses the OpenDoor.h file, along with the libODoors.a
file. These are included in the makefile, so everything should compile 
correctly.
